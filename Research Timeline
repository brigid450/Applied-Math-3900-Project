Week of 1/22/2019
Read two additional papers regarding the misprediction of precipitation in California based on El Niño 
Did further research on what causes the winds that may be a better predictor of precipitation

Week of 1/29/2019
Focused in on research project, looking at El Niño, wind, and precipitation together
Make a github profile, learn how it works
Play around with some data using xarray and share on github

Week of 2/5/2019
Learned about data libraries and “expert mode” 
Spent a great deal of time understanding xarray and cartopy better
Created month averaged maps of the correlation between sst and precipitation 
Included writing a correlation function because atm xarray does not have many built in correlation functions like it does for mean
Started thinking about how I can calculate statistical significance
(next step)
